write for me service include 3 part:
- using mockup data: following the TripOrders table in db.sql file, example: 5 trip.
- Auto update vehicle location:
    - use python
    - use rabbitmq (for publish)
    - use mockup data
    - write a script to auto update vehicle location from rabbitmq (every 10 seconds) for rabbitMQRequest.txt.

- RabbitMQ server:
    - use python
    - use rabbitmq
    - connect the `auto update vehicle location` part and `backend` part

- backend:
    - use python
    - use fastapi
    - use rabbitmq
    - use mockup data
    - prepare for connect to database
    main logic:
        - receive data from rabbitmq with info following the rabbitMQRequest.txt
        - with the vehicle_id, find the matching logic in the database (with current use mockup data)
        - with current vehicle gps, find the vehicles are in the true route or not.
            - if false, noti to the frontend and allow user to view the vehicle location on map, and the predicted route save in database
            - if true, do nothing
        - the backend will support frontend to view all the vehicles info (number of vehicles, number of vehicles in the true route, number of vehicles not in the true route)
        - allow user to view a specific vehicle info (location, speed, heading, odometer, and predicte routed)

- frontend:
    - use react
    - use tailwindcss
    - use mockup data
    - prepare for connect to backend
    - show the vehicles in front end (number of vehicles, number of vehicles in the true route, number of vehicles not in the true route)
    - allow user to view a specific vehicle info (location, speed, heading, odometer, and predicte routed)
    - allow user to view the vehicle not in the true route on map (hightlight to user observe the vehicle)
